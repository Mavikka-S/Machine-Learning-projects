# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my machine learning projects repository!  

This repo contains a collection of projects where I work through the entire ML pipeline â€” from data preprocessing and cleaning, to building models and applying AI to solve real-world problems.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** Handling raw data, cleaning, and preparing it for modeling.
- **Model Building:** Training and tuning machine learning models.
- **Experiments & Results:** Testing different approaches and tracking outcomes.
- **Applications:** Real-world use cases and AI solutions.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the projects and check out the code. Iâ€™ll be updating this repo regularly with new projects and improvements.

## Contributions

Suggestions and contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests.
